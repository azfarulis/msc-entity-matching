# MSc Project 2: "Neural record linkage and de-duplication"
Entity matching and record de-duplication project with Amazon Development Centre Scotland

# Objectives
1. Implement blocking
2. Train and compare DL and ML matching models
3. Implement transfer learning in low resource scenarios
4. Implement active learning in low resource scenarios
5. Try a combination of transfer and active learning in low resource scenarios â€¢ 6. Perform model checks (robustness to label noise, importance of words, etc)

# Data
Matching publication records from different sources 

- DBLP-Scholar: 2,616 and 64,263 records, 5,347 pairs
- Cora: 1,879 records, 64,578 pairs
